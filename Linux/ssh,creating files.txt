URL:
	- uniform resource locator 
	- used to locate/identify resources in the internet 
	- text, image, video, html, css, js, python, php, java etc

	Eg: https://subdomain.domain.com:8080/path/to/resources?key=value#fragment 
	
		https: protocol 
		domain: 
		sub domain: 
		.com: tld

ssh:
	- secure shell 
	- service used to remotely control a device/system 
	- both systems should be in same network 

linux:

modifying files and directories:

Creating files:

- using touch command:
	- used to create files 
	- light weight command 
	- if file already exist, it update last modified time 
	- if file not present it will create new file 
	Eg: touch filename 
	
- using redirection operator(>):
	- in linux everything is a file 
	- by default we have 3 file descriptors 
		- file 0 
			- input file 
		- file 1 
			- output 
		- file 2
			- error 
			
			

- command execution:
	- terminal -> shell -> command rasanu -> file0 -> shell search in PATH -> binary code 
	-> execute ( process ) -> output -> file1/file2 -> monitor 
	
	
- using cat command:
	- cat combined with > can create new file 
	- we can actually insert data into file when creating it 
	- ctrl+d is used to come out of cat prompt 
	Eg: cat > cat.txt
