TLS Handshaking:
	- used to establish https connection between server and client 
	- transport layer security 
	- current version : 3.0 
	- same as ssl ( secure socket layer )
	
1. client hello message 
	- hello msg 
	- available cipher suites 
	- client random : group of characters (VG6&8Hf$#$er%)
	
2. server hello message 
	- server sends hello msg to client 
	- server random 
	- server certificate 
	- server select one cipher suite from clients available cipher suites 
	
3. Authentication
	- client verify the server cerificate to authenticate the server domain 
	
4. Premaster secret key
	- client sends premaster key by encrypting it with server public key
	- server public key is in the server certificate 
	
5. Private key used
	- server decrypt the premaster key using it's private key 
	
6. Session key creation
	- client : client random, pre master secret key, server random 
	- server : server random, client random, pre master key
	- using an algo both client and server create symmetric key 
	
7. Client ready
	- client sends finished msg to server 

8. Server Ready 
	- Server sends finished msg to client 
	
9. secured symmetric encryption communication

Process Management:

Process:
	- program in execution 
	- binary programs ni execute 
	
- pcb 
	- process control block 
		- used to manage processes by os 
	- data structure 
		- double linked list 
		
	- Process ID 
	- Process State 
		- new, ready, running, waiting, terminate
	- Priority 
	- Program Counter 
	- CPU Registers 
	- PCB pointers 
	- open files 
	- i/o status 
	- etc 
	



#include<stdio.h>

int hack_fun(){
printf("hack fun");
return 0;
}

int main(){
printf("main fun");
return 0;
}


- in linux unlike windows every process can be run in terminal 
- creating user, installing software, managing network, etc can be done in terminal 
- tuning or controlling process execution is process management 


any process can be run in 2 ways:

- foreground process 
	- process which is running in the terminal 
	- by default every process is foreground 
	- when fg process is running we cannot use terminal 
	
- back ground process 
	- process which run in background 
	- we have to manually crteate back ground processes 
	- when bg process is running , we can use terminal for other processes
