1. private or symmetric key cryptography 

- using a same key for both encryption and decryption 
- source , destination will be using same key 
- execution will be fast 
- key sharing will be the biggest challange
- caesar cippher, block cipher, aes, des and more 

virat --> HBD (plain msg) --> encryption (123) --> cipher text --> internet --> destination 
destination --> decryption (123) -->  plain text --> DHONI 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Removing user:

using userdel command:
- user delete
- used to remove a user from linux os 

	Eg: userdel dhoni 
		userdel -r virat 
		userdel -r -f rohit 
		
		
sudo passwd root - change root password 
su root - change from kali to root account 


Software management:

- important feature 
- we do install/uninstall third party software into OS 
- we do update our softare/os 

- in debian systems software is managed by using apt tool 


using apt tool:

- advanced packeging tool 
- we can search, install, remove a software from linux os 


Searching for a package:
- in linux os even before adding a software we can search for particular package 
- we have to used keyword search to search for a package 

	Eg: apt-cache search software 
		apt-cache search nmap 
		
		
Adding / Installing a software:
- using install keyword along with apt 

	Eg: apt-get install software 
		apt-get install nmap 
		
		
Removing a software:
- we do have 2 kinds of removing keywords 

- using remove keyword 
- it will be removing only the software but not it's config file 

	Eg: apt-get remove nmap 
	
- using purge option 
- remove software along with it's configuration files 

	Eg: apt-get purge nmap 
	
	
	
updating system:
- updating software/ app/ os is very important as updates brings 
- add security
- add new features to our software 

- in linux updates wont reach us automatically as in windows 
- we have to manually update our system 

- in linux os we do have two kinds of updates 

- update , - upgrade 


- update
- it updates the list of software, applications that are ready to get update 

	Eg: sudo apt-get update 
	
	
upgrade 
- it actually updates every software that has updates 

	Eg: sudo apt-get upgrade 
	
	
Repository:

- repo
- server that holds the software for a particular distribution 
- every distro will be having a repo 

	Eg: nano /etc/apt/sources.list 
	
	
Process Management:

- program in execution 
- in linux, unlike windows all commands run on terminal/shell 
- tuning or controlling execution of a preocess is process management 

any process can be run in 2 ways:

foreground process :
- by default every process run as foreground process 
- process that runs on terminal 
- until foreground process completes it's execution we cannot use terminal 

background process :
- process which run on background 
- we can use terminal even background process do not completes it's execution 
- we have to manually create background process 


Types of processes:

parent process:
- process created by the user 
- all processes will have a parent process 
- kernel perocess will be parent processes if process is called by user directly 

child process:
- process created by another process 

orphan process:
- if a parent process completes it's execution even before child process 
- child process becomes orphan process 
- init process will be new parent for orphan process 

zombie process:
- if a process competes it's execution but shows up in process status 
- then it is called zombie process 

Daemon Process:
- system-related background processes
