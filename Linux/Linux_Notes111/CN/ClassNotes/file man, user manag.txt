Cryptography:
- study of mathematical alg that helps to securely communicate in insecured env i..e, internet 

common terminologies in cryptography:

plain text : msg or information 
cipher text : group of random characters that really do not display any info 
encryption : process of converting plain text to cipher text using key 
decryption : process of converting cipher text to plain text using key 
key : group of characetrs used in encry, decry 


virat --> dhoni 


virat --> HBD (plain msg) --> encryption (key) --> cipher text --> internet --> destination 
destination --> decryption (key) -->  plain text --> DHONI 


types of cryptography:

communication: (two way functions)
1. private key or symmetric key cryptography 
2. public key or assymetric key cryptography

data integrity: (one way function)
3. Hashing

file permissions:

- very important 
- directly impact on security of os 

using chmod command:

- change mode 
- used to change permissions for a file 

permissions in os 

read(r) : we can access data inside file/folder 
write(w) : we can change /alter data in file/folder 
execute(x): we can execute/ run file 

permissions are given to three set of people

owner(u): who actually creates the file/folder 
group(g): every user is associated with a group 
others(o): everyone other than group and owner comes under others 

ls -l 

drwxrwxrwx

d : file / folder 
rwx : permissions of owner 
rwx : group permissions 
rwx : other permissions 


we can change permissions of a file/ folder using 2 ways 

1. using operators 

+ : add a permission 
- : removes a permission 
= : replicates permission 


	Eg: chmod u+x file 
		chmod u-x,g+w,o+r abc 
		chmod u=rwx abc 
		chmod a+x abc 

2. using numeric codes 

rwx 

000 - 0 - no permissions
001 - 1 - execute
010 - 2 - write 
011 - 3 - write and execute 
100 - 4 - read 
101 - 5 - read and execute 
110 - 6 - read and write 
111 - 7 - all permissions 

	Eg: chmod 123 abc 
		chmod 456 abc 
		chmod 777 abc

user management:

Adding user:

using adduser command:
- used to add a new user into linux os 

backend process:

- controller will edit the following files 
	/etc/passwd 
	/etc/shadow
	/etc/group
	/etc/gshadow 
	
- creating a new directory in home folder
- assigning required default permissions to the new folder created 


/etc/passwd 
- information about users in linux os 

kali:x:1000:1000:,,,:/home/kali:/usr/bin/zsh

kali : username 
x : password is stored in /etc/shadow 
1000 : uid 
1000 : gid 
,,,, : info abou user 
/home/kali : user info folder 
/usr/bin/zsh : shell associated with the user 


	Eg: adduser username 
		adduser -u 8765 pop 
		adduser -u 6578 -gid 8765 bob
