plain text: msg or data that contains information
	- Eg: my password is 9876543210
cipher text: group of characters that do not convey any information 
	- Eg: Ch&65Hn>?vhGF&6&*H
encryption: converting plain text to cipher text using key 
decryption: converting cipher text to plain text using key 
key: group of characters used in both encryptionand decryption
