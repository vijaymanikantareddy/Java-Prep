Domains in Cybersecurity:
	- Communications 
	- Data Integrity 
	
- Communications
	- symmetric key cryptography or private key cryptography
	- assymetric key cryptography or public key cryptography
	
dhoni -> virat 

dhoni -> msg -> encryption (key) -> cipher text -> internet -> destination 
-> decryption(key) -> plain text -> kohli
	
	
- symmetric key cryptography or private key cryptography
	- we will use same key in both encryption and decryption 
	- very fast 
	- block cipher, aes, des etc 
	- key sharing between source and destination is problem 

dhoni -> msg -> encryption (key1) -> cipher text -> internet -> destination 
-> decryption(key1) -> plain text -> kohli


- asymmetric key cryptography or public key cryptography
	- we will use different keys in encryption and decryption 
	- slow 
	- rsa, diffie hellman, elliptical curve cryptography.. etc 
	
	dhoni - d.pub : access to dhoni and kohli and world 
			d.pri : only access to dhoni
			
	virat - v.pub : access to dhoni and kohli and world 
			v.pri : only access to virat
			

dhoni -> virat 

dhoni -> msg -> encryption (v.pub) -> cipher text -> internet -> destination 
-> decryption(v.pri) -> plain text -> kohli


real time:

- real world will use both symmetric and assymetric key cryptography
- first they use assymetric key cryptography to send symmetric key to destination 
- after they will continue in symmetric key cryptography
