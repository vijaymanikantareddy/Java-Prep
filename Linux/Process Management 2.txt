Types of Processes:

- Parent Process:
	- in linux every process contains parent process 
	- even processes that we create in terminal has parent process 
	- kernel will be parent process for terminal process 
	
- Child Process:
	- process created by another process 
	
- Orphan Process:
	- child process should complete it's execution first before parent process 
	- if parent process completes it's execution before child process
	- then child process is orphan process 
	
- Zombie Process:
	- process that is still in ps even after execution completion 
	- they do not consume any cpu 
	
- Daemon Process:
	- system background processes 
	
	
Commands:

- using ps 
	- it display current processes in the terminal 
	- process state 
	Eg: ps 
		ps -e : display running daemons 
		ps -f : processes info in full form 
		ps -ef 
		ps aux : list every process running in the linux os 
		
- jobs
	- used to display running or suspended processes in the background 
	
- creating a background process
	- we have to add "&" after command to make it run in background 
	Eg: ls & 
		whoami & 
		
- bringing background process to foreground
	- fg % PID 




- videostreaming.c 
	- thread1 
		- audio 
	- thread2 
		- video 
	- thread3 
		- audio+video
